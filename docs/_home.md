# CxSAST Consolidated Report

An utility to generate consolidated reports from the CxSast scaned projects.

This tool looks for the **last finished scans** of the selected projects and sends a consolidated report to a given mailing list. This way, its possible to combine scan results of multiple projects into one unique report giving the user(s) the an full results overview.
This maybe more usefull when a project is composed by multiple sub-projects for instance a project composed by multiple microservices scanned independently.
